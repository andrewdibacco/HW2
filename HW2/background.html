        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/cleveland.jpg" align="middle" height="225" width="225" title="Cleveland">
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="text">I was born in Cleveland and have lived in the area my entire life. Some of my hobbies include writing, music production and cooking. I was married in Pittsburgh this past summer and bought a house in Willoughby around the same time. We have one cat, and his name is Bartleby. </span>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/bw_logo.png" align="middle" height="225" width="225" title="Baldwin-Wallace University">
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="text">I earned a B.S in Mathematical Economics and Creative Writing with a minor in Statistics from Baldwin-Wallace University. Over the course of my degree, I learned about topics such as Linear Algebra, Calculus, desiging empirical studies, and writing poetry and short stories. By taking classes that require both creative and critical thinking skills, I feel I have gained the tools to help me to approach problems from different angles.</span>

        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/computer.jpg" align="middle">
        <br/><br/>
            <span class="text">Within the next year, I plan to be working as a full stack software developer. I have some professional experience related to IT, but often times those tasks would take a back seat to more sales support oriented tasks. In order to truly immerse myself in the coding community, I quit my job and joined the Cleveland Codes program at Tri-C. I expect to learn all the tehcnical skills I need to start as an entry-level web developer, but all the professional skills to be able to land an interview and make a lasting impression on any potential future employers.</span>
